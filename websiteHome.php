		</div>
		<p>Year 1972 saw the beginnings of Dolljoy Factory as backyard cottage-industry in Mandaluyong City. Back in those days, the owners’ four daughters always received dolls as presents so they thought of making their own dolls.</p>
        <p> In the 1980’s, the proponents met Samuel Butcher, the creator and owner of Precious Moments Company, whose dolls were known for its teardrop-shaped eyes. He commissioned Dolljoy to manufacture these dolls which were released only in the USA.</p>

		</div>
        <p>Early 2007, Dolljoy Factory and Museum was conceptualized and started opening its doors to educational tours with the intent of showcasing the innate talent of the Filipinos in designing and creating dolls. As far as having a simulated factory on how the dolls were made from very first step.</p>
